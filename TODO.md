# TDL:
- Add home lock logic
- Fix the answer to the porch lock.

# Done:
- Upload this to a static webpage I can access from my phone. _uploaded using githubPages_
- Check how I can use QR code to open my webpage. _Using QR code generator I can create QR code that open an url_
- Add routing so every puzzle will be in a different page.
- Check if there is an issue when navigating directly into a puzzle on the github page. If the navigation won't work
add a navigation back to the homepage from each puzzle/lock. _Fixed by using HashRouter that adds # to the pages_
- Handle QR codes.

# Out of scope:
- Change the icon in the browser to something else.
- Change the domain.
